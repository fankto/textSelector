textSelector demonstrates modern Android development practices:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph UI Layer
        A[MainActivity] --> B[PinnedEditText]
        A --> C[SavedSelectionsAdapter]
        B --> D[Custom Touch Handler]
        D --> E[GestureDetector]
    end

    subgraph ViewModel Layer
        F[MainViewModel] --> G[Selection State]
        F --> H[Search Logic]
    end

    subgraph Data Layer
        I[textSelectorRepository] --> J[Room Database]
        J --> K[SavedSelectionDao]
    end

    F --> I
    A --> F
```
