Last updated: February 6, 2025

## Introduction

TextSelector is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our Android application ("TextSelector" or "the app").

## Information Collection and Use

TextSelector operates entirely offline and stores all data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.

### Local Data Storage

The app stores the following information locally on your device:
- Text selections you choose to save
- Names you assign to your saved selections
- Timestamps of when selections were saved
- Internal identifiers for managing your saved selections

This data is stored using Android's Room database, which is contained within the app's private storage area on your device.

## Data Access and Control

- All data stored by TextSelector is only accessible through the app on your device
- The app cannot access any data outside of its designated storage area
- No data is shared with third parties or transmitted over the internet
- You can delete all stored data by either:
    - Using the delete function within the app
    - Uninstalling the app from your device

## Data Security

Your saved selections are stored securely in the app's private database on your device, protected by Android's built-in security features. Since no data is transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.

## Children's Privacy

TextSelector is a general-purpose text selection tool and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
